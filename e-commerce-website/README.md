Project Overview
This is a simple Amazon homepage clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage displays different product categories, and clicking on a category reveals or hides the available items. This design mimics Amazon’s UI, where users first see categories, and only upon clicking do they see products.

Features
✔️ Responsive Navbar – Includes a logo, search bar, and cart icon.
✔️ Hero Section – Displays a promotional banner at the top.
✔️ Dynamic Category Display – Initially, only categories are visible, and clicking on them reveals the products.
✔️ Smooth Toggle Effect – Products smoothly appear/disappear when clicking categories.
✔️ Organized File Structure – Images, CSS, and JavaScript files are neatly structured.
✔️ Mobile-Friendly Design – The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structuring the webpage.
CSS3 – For styling and layout.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – For category toggle functionality.
